# COLA

The code is modified based on [COLA](https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/COLA/tree/main), and the datasets in ```/SemEval``` are modified from [SemEval-2016 Task 6](https://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task6/index.php?id=data-and-tools).

This project performs stance analysis on tweets, which consists of three stages with seven collaborative LLM agents (linguistic expert, domain specialist, social media veteran, pro-view debater, anti-view debater, stance concluder).  
The agents, through their assigned roles, activate their embedded domain knowledge to conduct a multi-dimensional analysis and reasoning of the tweets, ultimately determining the final stance through debate:

## Run  

Modify the LLM and API key in `cola.py`:  
```
client = OpenAI(api_key="sk-xx", base_url="") # base_url="https://api.deepseek.com"
'''
client = AzureOpenAI(
api_key="", # your api key
api_version="", # replace
azure_endpoint="https://hkust.azure-api.net") # replace
'''

python cola.py
```  
The code takes `/SemEval/small.csv` as an example input, which contains tweet, target, and stance. The domain specialist determines the relevant domain as prior knowledge based on the target.  

## Result  
Stance accuracy:  
| Model               | Accuracy     |
|---------------------|--------------|
| gpt-35-turbo        | 0.6667 (66.67%) |
| gpt-4o-mini         | 0.6667 (66.67%) |
| gpt-4o              | 0.7333 (73.33%) |
| deepseek-chat (V3)  | 0.8000 (80.00%) |

### AzureOpenAI API bug  
The linguistic expert agent gets stuck and fails to output when analyzing the last line of Tweet in small.csv, but it works fine when analyzed separately in error.py.  
```
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("result_cola.csv")
last_row_value = df.iloc[-1]['Linguist Analysis']
print(last_row_value) # "Error"
```
